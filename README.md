## About Me
I'm a student, programmer, and content creator based in Canada.
I code at every opportunity that I can. I primarily do competitive programming on platforms such as DMOJ. My GitHub is for personal projects outside of DMOJ.
## Skills
I can program in Java, C#, C++, Javascript (Node.js), and Python. I have more experience in some languages more than others.
